QUASR is intended to be a self-contained pipeline that has minimal requirements:

1) It is written in Python3, so the Python3 interpreter must be installed.
2) Graphing requires R to be installed.
3) To use any of the pileup_* scripts in the extras/ folder, SAMtools is recommended
   to create the pileup file.



If you have these installed, follow these steps to get QUASR running:

1a) Change the top line of readset_parser.py, quality_control.py, and all scripts in
    the extras/ folder to the location of your Python3 interpreter.

OR

1b) Just call the script with python3 (or full path to python3 interpreter). EG:
    python3 readset_parser.py or
    /path_to_python3_binary/python3 readset_parser.py

2) In the same files, change the line near the top that reads:
   sys.path.append('/nfs/users/nfs_s/sw10/QUASR6/modules/')
   to:
   sys.path.append('full_path_to_QUASR_folder/modules/')
